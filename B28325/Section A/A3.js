//Explain the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript.
//What happens if you try to reassign values to variables declared with let or const?


// Var: can be redeclared and reassigned
// Let: can be reassigned but not redeclared
// Const: cannot be reassigned or redeclared


// let: You can reassign a new value to a let variable without issue.
// const: You cannot reassign a new value to a const variable. Because this will result in an error.
